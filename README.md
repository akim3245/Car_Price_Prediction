# Car Price Prediction
Predict car prices using machine learning (XGBoost Regressor)

### Project Goal
The purpose of this project is to predict car prices with machine learning using a cars dataset consisting of information such as car brands, model, and year.

### Methods & Technologies
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Python
* Pandas 
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
To better understand the dataset used, the predictive features were explored and analyzed to answer questions like, *what are the top selling car brands and models*, *which car brands and models are more on the expensive side*, *what colors are most popular*, *which car is the most expensive*, *what features are correlated with a high price value*, and etc.
After preprocessing the data, XGBoost Regressor was used to train and make predictions on the test set.
